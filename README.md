# Lending-Club-Case-Study

Business Objective
The largest online loan marketplace lending Club facilitates different types of loans such as personal loans, business loans etc and also financing of medical procedures. The interest rate on loans are very low which encourages borrowers to avail loan through a fast online interface.

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who are categorized as defaultee causes the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In our Case Study, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaultees'.

The Objective of this study is to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
